            <h2>Observing the Invisible</h2>
            <p>In the 1930s, the field of astrophysics was revolutionized by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky's study of the Coma Cluster, a massive collection of over a thousand galaxies. Zwicky employed innovative observational techniques for the era, including measuring galactic velocities using the Doppler effect. His meticulous calculations revealed a startling discrepancy: the visible mass of these galaxies, composed of stars and gas, was vastly insufficient to account for the gravitational forces holding the cluster together. This observation suggested the presence of an unseen mass, far exceeding that which was observable.

Zwicky termed this mysterious entity "Dunkle Materie" or Dark Matter, a concept that was initially met with skepticism due to its challenge to existing astronomical paradigms. However, his hypothesis fundamentally altered our understanding of the universe. It introduced the notion that most of the universe's mass is not visible through conventional telescopic observations. Over time, as technology advanced and further studies corroborated Zwicky's findings, the existence of dark matter became a cornerstone of modern cosmology. Today, Zwicky's legacy endures his early insights laying the groundwork for ongoing research into one of the cosmos' most enigmatic components. His work not only demonstrated the power of observational astronomy but also opened the door to new questions about the nature and composition of the universe.</p>
            <h3>Galaxy Rotation Curves</h3>
            <p>Another pivotal piece of evidence supporting the existence of dark matter emerges from analyzing galaxy rotation curves. In a galaxy, according to Newtonian mechanics, one would expect the rotational speeds to decrease with increasing distance from the center, much like the way planets in our solar system orbit faster and closer to the Sun. However, observations have consistently shown that the outer regions of galaxies rotate at nearly the same speed as the inner regions. This surprising uniformity in rotational velocity, extending far beyond the areas where visible matter is present, strongly implies that an additional, unseen mass is exerting gravitational influence. This mass, not detectable by conventional telescopic methods, effectively flattens the expected velocity curve of the galaxy's rotation. The presence of this unseen mass, hypothesized as dark matter, provides a crucial explanation for these bizarre galactic behaviors and challenges our understanding of the universe's mass distribution and composition.</p>
            <h3>Gravitational Lensing</h3>
            <p>Gravitational lensing, a phenomenon where light is bent by the gravitational effects of massive objects, offers another method for detecting dark matter. When light from distant galaxies passes near massive structures, such as those composed of dark matter, it is deflected in a way similar to light passing through a lens. This results in distorted, magnified, or even multiple images of the same galaxy, observable from Earth. These distortions provide indirect but powerful evidence of dark matter's presence, as the amount of visible mass in these structures is insufficient to cause such dramatic bending of light. This effect has been observed and documented in numerous cases, turning gravitational lensing into a vital tool for mapping the distribution of dark matter across the cosmos. It allows astronomers to infer the location and mass of dark matter, furthering our understanding of its role in the structure and evolution of the universe.</p>
