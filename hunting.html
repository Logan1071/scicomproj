            <h2>Hunting for Dark Matter</h2>
            <p>In the quest to uncover the secrets of dark matter, scientists have embarked on a series of innovative and sophisticated experiments. These efforts aim to detect dark matter particles directly.</p>
            
            <h3>Direct Detection</h3>
            <p>In July 2012, the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) dark matter detector was installed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. By October 2013, it became known as the world's most sensitive dark matter detector. Although it didn't find dark matter, researchers remained optimistic about its future potential. The LUX experiment aims to detect dark matter in the form of WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles), primarily observable through their gravitational effects. At its core, the experiment uses a tank filled with ultra-pure liquid xenon, cooled to minus 160 degrees F. This xenon setup is surrounded by photosensors to detect single photons, which are expected to be emitted when a WIMP interacts with a xenon atom. The detector's deep underground location in a large water tank helps shield it from cosmic radiation and other external 'noise,' enhancing its sensitivity to potential dark matter interactions.</p>
            
            <h3>Particle Accelerators</h3>
            <p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other particle accelerators smash together protons at near-light speeds, potentially creating dark matter particles. A recent dark matter search didn't find direct evidence but provided valuable constraints for future studies. While most of the universe's mass is believed to be dark matter, its composition remains a mystery. Efforts to detect Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a leading dark matter candidate, have been unsuccessful, even with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As a result, physicists like Deepak Kar are exploring new theories, suggesting dark matter might interact more strongly with certain Standard Model particles. Kar and his colleague, Sukanya Sinha, propose investigating high-energy proton collisions in the LHC to detect "semi-visible" jets. These jets, a mixture of normal and dark particles, could reveal dark matter through an energy imbalance in the collision aftermath, offering a new direction in the quest to understand dark matter.</p>
