            <h2>Dark Matterâ€™s Cosmic Role</h2>
            <p>Dark matter is more than just an astronomical curiosity; it plays a fundamental role in shaping our universe.</p>
            
            <h3>Galaxy Formation</h3>
            <p>Dark matter's role in galaxy formation is fundamental and profound. In the universe's infancy, following the Big Bang, it existed as a cold, non-luminous substance, forming vast halos in the cosmic expanse. These halos of dark matter created gravitational potentials that became the focal points for the accumulation of baryonic matter, comprising gas and dust. These regions of increased gravity attracted surrounding matter, initiating the process of galaxy formation. The intriguing aspect of dark matter in this context is its ability to clump together due to gravitational attraction, despite its elusive and intangible nature. This clustering effect was essential in overcoming the universe's initial uniformity and homogeneity, leading to the uneven distribution of matter that facilitated the birth of galaxies. The specific distribution and density of dark matter halos directly influenced the size, shape, and type of galaxies that formed, ranging from spiral galaxies like our Milky Way to massive elliptical galaxies.</p>
            <h3>Cosmic Web</h3>
            <p>The cosmic web represents the universe's grandest scale structure, a testament to the influence of dark matter. Comprising filaments, nodes, and voids, this web-like structure is a result of the gravitational pull of dark matter acting over cosmic time. The filaments, which are long, interconnected strands of dark matter, attract regular matter and are the sites where galaxies and galaxy clusters predominantly form and reside. At the intersections of these filaments, known as nodes, the largest structures, like clusters and superclusters of galaxies, are found. Surrounding these nodes and filaments are vast cosmic voids, regions with very little matter, both dark and baryonic. This structure has been mapped through extensive surveys of the universe, revealing a complex pattern that resembles a three-dimensional web. The detailed study of the cosmic web not only gives insight into the large-scale structure of the universe but also into the nature of dark matter itself, such as its distribution and how it influences the dynamics of galaxies and clusters.</p>
            <h3>Influence on Cosmic Evolution</h3>
            <p>The influence of dark matter on cosmic evolution is both subtle and significant. It plays a dual role, both as a stabilizing force and as a catalyst for cosmic structure formation. One of its most critical contributions is to the overall dynamics of the universe's expansion. While dark energy is driving the acceleration of this expansion, dark matter exerts a gravitational pull that works against this acceleration. This tug-of-war between dark matter and dark energy is a key factor in determining the rate at which the universe expands. Additionally, dark matter's gravitational pull affects not just the large-scale structure of the universe but also more localized phenomena like the formation of galaxy clusters and the behavior of galaxies within these clusters. Its presence can be inferred from phenomena such as gravitational lensing, where the path of light from distant galaxies is bent by the gravitational influence of dark matter. Understanding dark matter is therefore crucial to cosmology, as it holds keys to many unanswered questions about the universe's formation, its current state, and its eventual fate.</p>
