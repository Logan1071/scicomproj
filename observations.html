            <h2>Observing the Invisible</h2>
            <p>In the 1930s, the field of astrophysics was revolutionized by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky's study of the Coma Cluster, a massive collection of over a thousand galaxies. Zwicky employed innovative observational techniques for the era, including measuring galactic velocities using the Doppler effect. His meticulous calculations revealed a startling discrepancy: the visible mass of these galaxies, composed of stars and gas, was vastly insufficient to account for the gravitational forces holding the cluster together. This observation suggested the presence of an unseen mass, far exceeding that which was observable.

Zwicky termed this mysterious entity "Dunkle Materie" or Dark Matter, a concept that was initially met with skepticism due to its challenge to existing astronomical paradigms. However, his hypothesis fundamentally altered our understanding of the universe. It introduced the notion that the majority of the universe's mass is not visible through conventional telescopic observations. Over time, as technology advanced and further studies corroborated Zwicky's findings, the existence of dark matter became a cornerstone of modern cosmology. Today, Zwicky's legacy endures, his early insights laying the groundwork for ongoing research into one of the cosmos' most enigmatic components. His work not only demonstrated the power of observational astronomy but also opened the door to new questions about the nature and composition of the universe.</p>
            <h3>Galaxy Rotation Curves</h3>
            <p>Another key evidence for dark matter comes from the rotation curves of galaxies. The outer regions of galaxies rotate at similar speeds to their inner regions, defying the expectations of Newtonian mechanics if only visible matter were present. This suggests that a significant amount of unseen mass must be influencing the gravitational forces at work.</p>
            
            <h3>Gravitational Lensing</h3>
            <p>Dark matter can also be detected through its gravitational effects on light, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Massive dark matter structures can bend the light from distant galaxies, causing distorted or multiple images of the same galaxy. This effect has been observed in many instances and serves as a powerful tool for mapping dark matter in the universe.</p>
